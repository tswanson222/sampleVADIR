\title{Rank to pay grade data}
\format{
A data frame with six variables that links pay grades to military
ranks within each military branch. \code{PayGrade} indicates the pay grade
associated with a specific job title (\code{Title}) within a given
\code{Branch} of the military. \code{Title} designates the job title, where
\code{Initials} is the shorthand for each title (this is how the
\code{RANK_CD} variable is coded in the VADIR dataset). \code{Branch}
designates the military branch, where \code{"N"} stands for Navy, \code{"A"}
stands for Army, \code{"M"} stands for Marines, and \code{"F"} stands for
Air Force. \code{PayCat4} represents one coding scheme that categorizes
different pay grades into four categories, where \code{"E"} stands for
enlisted, \code{"NCO"} stands for non-commissioned officer, \code{"W"}
stands for warrant officer, and \code{"O"} stands for commissioned officer.
\code{PayCat7} represents an alternative categorization that breaks pay
grades into seven categories, wherein \code{"SNCO"} stands for senior
non-commissioned officer, \code{"FGO"} stands for field grade officer,
\code{"CGO"} stands for company grade officer, and \code{"GO"} stands for
general officer.

\description{
Serves as a key for relating certain military rank designations with pay
grades. Used in the \code{sampleVADIR()} function for stratifying based on pay
grade rather than rank.
}
\details{
The way these data are used in the \code{sampleVADIR()} function is by
indexing the values of the \code{RANK_CD} variable of the VADIR dataset
against the \code{Initials} variable in the present dataset, and then the
\code{RANK_CD} value is replaced with the associated value in either the
\code{PayCat4} or \code{PayCat7} variable depending on what is specified in
the \code{sampleVADIR()} function. The purpose of this is to make the
\code{RANK_CD} variable more amenable to stratification, given the difficultly
of stratifying across values of a categorical variable with so many unique
values.
