<!-- badges: end -->

R package designed to afford researchers the ability to draw stratified
samples from the U.S. Department of Veteran’s Affairs/Department of
Defense Identity Repository (VADIR) database according to a variety of
parameters. The VADIR database contains information for all veterans who
were separated from the military after 1980. This package is intended to
be used in conjunction with VADIR data in order to pull nationally
representative samples of veterans for research purposes. Actual VADIR
data not supplied with this package. More information about the VADIR
database can be found
